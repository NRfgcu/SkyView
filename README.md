This is just going to be a repository where we can add work that is incomplete or still being worked on, I added some basic code where the API is imported and basic data is shown, from here we can start manipulating it to pull and the display the data we need. Since the API
being used uses corridinates we can add a library that would have corrdinates for cities entered by the user. Bellow is the link to download the Curl software to be used to read APIs. In class we can both get set up on our laptops so we can start to get this in motion.
I had to use some curl documentation to ensure I was using the right syntax I'll have the link to that bellow so we can cite that for the project.
